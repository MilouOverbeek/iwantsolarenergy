				<h3>Solar Panels</h3>
				<p id="attribute4">
					A solar panel is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells. These cells are
					mounted in a framework. The cells are able to transform sunlight in
					electricity, as they are able to use it as a source of energy. In 1839
					some materials were able to create electrical charges from light
					exposure. This phenomenon was first observed by Alexandre-Edmond
					Becquerel/ Willoughby Smith added the fact that the charge could be
					caused by light hitting selenium.

				<h3>Charge Controller</h3>
				<p id="attribute5">
					A charge controller is an instrument that can limit the rate at which
					electric currents are added or drawn to batteries. This means that it
					is capable of preventing something from overcharging and it may
					protect against overvoltage. Overvoltage can cause the reduce of
					battery life. It can also prevent a bettery from draining completely.
					They often go with solar and wind power generators. Some charge
					controllers are capable of disabling further current flow into a
					battery when they are full.

				<h3>Battery System</h3>
				<p id="attribute6">
					A battery system is an electronic system that manages a rechargeable
					battery, such as protecting the battery, monitoring itâ€™s state etc. It
					can monitor things such as voltage, temperature, coolant flow and the
					current. The battery system can also control the recharge of a
					battery. It does this by redirecting recovered energy back into the
					battery. It also houses a precharge system which allows it to safelt
					connect the battery to different loads.

				<h3>Direct Current</h3>
				<p id="attribute7">
					A dc or direct current is a current which is one directional or
					undirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a
					good example of dc. A dc can flow through multiple things, such as
					semiconductors, insulators and a vacuum. It flows in one direction
					distinguishing it from an ac. It as many uses such as, charging
					batteries from smaller devices to bigger ones like motors. It is
					sometimes used for railways, especially in urban areas. High voltage
					is used to transmit large amounts of power.
				</p>

				<h3>Inverter</h3>
				<p id="attribute8">
					An inverter is a device which changes a dc or direct current to an ac
					or alternating current. It depends on the model and build of the
					device to dtermine the input voltage, output voltage and frequency and
					overal power handling. It does not produce power, it only redirects.
					It can be entirely electronice or it can be a mix of mechanical
					effects. They are primarily used in electrical power applications. In
					these applications high currents and voltages are present.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="attribute9">
				<h3>Alternating Current</h3>
				<p>
					An ac or alternating current is a current which reversed direction
					periodically. It changes its magnitude continuously with time. This
					contrasts with the dc which is a one direction current. Ac is the form
					in which electricity is delivered and residences. It is also the
					energy that consumers typically use when they plug in kitchen
					appliances. The waveform of an ac is usually a sine-wave. This
					corresponds with the positive direction of the current and vice versa.
